Adds additional directories that are under the same directory as the owning
(GameFeature-) Asset to the GameplayCueManager's search path.   
Those directories will be added the moment your GameFeature is registered and removed when it is unregistered.

> üìùAfter adding a new directory to the search path, the GameplayCueManager will not automatically update.    
> Which means you need to restart the editor to apply the changes.
